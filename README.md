# 16bit-Computer
i'm creating an emulator of 16 bit computer witch contain CPU, RAM and Display
# How its work
after compilation,
in your terminal, command prompt or powershell, run this command:

"./build/computer ./build/test.bin"

the first is the path of the 16bit-computer executable file, and you pass the path of the binary file that has the code to execut it in the 16bit-computer.
